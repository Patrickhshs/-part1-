Firstly, the data are pre-processed by normalizing the scores of news into a sequence of values of the same length of 100 by dct transform. After that, the data is sliced into training and test sets, and the model is trained. Next, the data selected by active learning is given to Oracle for labeling, and then the trained model is imported for metrics calculation to find the news that differ from the Oracle labeling and analyze them. Then we use the Oracle labeled news to retrain the model and calculate the metrics, and so on, until we reach the standard.
